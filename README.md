## 📄 Project Overview
**NexTech Solutions** is a high-fidelity, responsive landing page designed for a fictional technology company. 

This project serves as my **"Vanilla CSS Capstone"**—a final challenge to demonstrate mastery of core CSS concepts (Positioning, Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries) before transitioning to CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and the MERN stack.

Unlike my WordPress background where themes handle the heavy lifting, every pixel here was styled manually to ensure a deep understanding of the browser rendering engine.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Hero Section:** Full-width background with semi-transparent overlays and centered typography using absolute positioning.
* **Responsive Portfolio Grid:** A custom-built 3-column card layout using **CSS Grid** that adapts seamlessly to tablet and mobile screens.
* **Modern Form Styling:** Custom-styled contact form inputs (removing default browser styles) for a cohesive UI look.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Strategic use of whitespace, font weights, and color accents (Green/Blue gradient theme) to guide user attention.
* **Semantic HTML:** Clean, readable markup structure optimized for SEO and accessibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Structure:** Semantic HTML5
* **Styling:** Pure CSS3 (No Frameworks)
* **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Roboto / Open Sans)
* **Icons:** FontAwesome (or whichever you used)

## 🧠 What I Learned
Building this without Bootstrap forced me to solve common layout problems manually:
1.  **The "Div Center" Challenge:** Mastered centering elements both horizontally and vertically using `display: flex` and `place-items: center`.
2.  **Z-Index Management:** managing stacking contexts in the Hero section to keep text readable above the background graphics.
3.  **Box Model:** Gaining total control over `padding`, `margin`, and `border-box` sizing to prevent layout shifts.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
If you want to view the code structure:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nextech-landing-page.git](https://github.com/your-username/nextech-landing-page.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nextech-landing-page
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## 🔜 Next Steps
Now that I have solidified my understanding of raw CSS, my roadmap includes:
- [ ] Refactoring this layout using **Bootstrap 5** to compare development speed.
- [ ] Moving to **JavaScript** logic.
- [ ] Starting my journey into **React.js**.
